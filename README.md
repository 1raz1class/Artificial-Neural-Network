# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples for my book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski
has a repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35). I

## The book will teach you about:

### 1. 
Neural networks, a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data
### 2.
Deep learning, a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks
